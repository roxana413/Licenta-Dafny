A specification and implementation of an algorithm that solves the Weighted Job Scheduling problem (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/weighted-job-scheduling/) in Dafny.

The folder ```Dafny``` contains a verified implementation of the Weighted Job Scheduling algorithm using (mostly) immutable data structures.
To build and run the executable:
```
    dafny run day.dfy
```

(you will need .NET installed on your computer)

To simply verify the development:
```
    dafny /trace day.dfy
```
